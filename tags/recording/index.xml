      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following piece was written in August 2020 following my work on The Breakfast Plays for Traverse Theatre and was originally published as part of the &#xA;&lt;a href = https://www.traverse.co.uk/news/taking-the-breakfast-plays-new-tracks-from-page-to-audio-stage target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Traverse blog&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Breakfast Plays are part of the Traverse&amp;rsquo;s creative development programme for writers and are normally performed for Festival audiences throughout August. 2020 was a little different and required a new approach given the closure of theatres during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Traverse approached me to help them to record the scripts for audio production, with everyone involved working remotely from home.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;This was new ground for all involved and presented a number of challenges, some of which I discuss below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
