      <description>My approach Theatrical design is a collaboration in story telling. I seek to support those around me in telling that tale and aim to inspire their work with my sound design, as I find inspiration in theirs. Our creativity is at its best when the individual elements shape and elevate each other.
 My design Sound design should consider both what you hear and how you hear it. Designing a system that supports the needs of the show is as nuanced as the sound that is played through it, and both aspects are critical to a successful design.</description>
