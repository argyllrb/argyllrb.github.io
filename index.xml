      <description>My approach Theatrical design is a collaboration in story telling. I seek to support those around me in telling that tale and aim to inspire their work with my sound design, as I find inspiration in theirs. Our creativity is at its best when the individual elements shape and elevate each other.
 My design Sound design should consider both what you hear and how you hear it. Designing a system that supports the needs of the show is as nuanced as the sound that is played through it, and both aspects are critical to a successful design.</description>

      <description>The following piece was written in August 2020 following my work on The Breakfast Plays for Traverse Theatre and was originally published as part of the Traverse blog .
The Breakfast Plays are part of the Traverse&amp;rsquo;s creative development programme for writers and are normally performed for Festival audiences throughout August. 2020 was a little different and required a new approach given the closure of theatres during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Traverse approached me to help them to record the scripts for audio production, with everyone involved working remotely from home.</description>

 Below are a few clips from my sound design for Zombies, Run! uploaded with permission from Six to Start .
Zombies, Run! is a running app that mixes an audio adventure with your music. It places you in the shoes of ‘Runner 5’ as you collect supplies for your settlement and investigate the real story behind the zombie apocalypse. Headphones are recommended but not essential.</description>
