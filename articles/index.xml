      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following piece was written in August 2020 following my work on The Breakfast Plays for Traverse Theatre and was originally published as part of the &#xA;&lt;a href = https://www.traverse.co.uk/news/taking-the-breakfast-plays-new-tracks-from-page-to-audio-stage target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Traverse blog&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Breakfast Plays are part of the Traverse&amp;rsquo;s creative development programme for writers and are normally performed for Festival audiences throughout August. 2020 was a little different and required a new approach given the closure of theatres during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Traverse approached me to help them to record the scripts for audio production, with everyone involved working remotely from home.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;This was new ground for all involved and presented a number of challenges, some of which I discuss below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article originally published in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are a few clips from my sound design for &#xA;&lt;a href = https://zombiesrungame.com/ target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zombies, Run!&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; uploaded with permission from &#xA;&lt;a href = https://www.sixtostart.com/ target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Six to Start&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zombies, Run! is a running app that mixes an audio adventure with your music. It places you in the shoes of ‘Runner 5’ as you collect supplies for your settlement and investigate the real story behind the zombie apocalypse. Headphones are recommended but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
